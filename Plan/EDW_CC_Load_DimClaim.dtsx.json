        "Input Data": "750 GB (DimClaim table and related datasets)",
        "Output Data": "75 GB (Approximately 10% of the input data processed)"

      "Time Taken for Each Phase": {
        "Shuffle-heavy JOINs": "2 hours",
        "Wide Transforms (e.g., ROLLUP, DENORMALIZE)": "3 hours",

        "Pricing Model (e.g., DBU, vCPU Hour)": "Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.0146 - $0.1008 per hour",
