    "1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost": {
      "Cluster Configuration": {
        "Number of Executors": 4,
        "Executor Memory": "16 GB",
        "Driver Memory": "8 GB"
      },
      "Approximate Data Volume Processed": {
        "Input Data": "Approximately 850 GB from dbo.cc_check and related tables, including joins and transformations.",
        "Output Data": "Approximately 900 GB into dbo.DimCheck after processing and transformations."
      },
      "Time Taken for Each Phase": {
        "Shuffle-heavy JOINs": "2 hours",
        "Wide Transforms (e.g., ROLLUP, DENORMALIZE)": "3 hours",
        "Output Writes": "1 hour"
      },
      "Cost Model": {
        "Pricing Model (e.g., DBU, vCPU Hour)": "Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.0146 - $0.1008 per hour, depending on cluster size and cloud provider.",
        "Total Runtime Cost": "Estimated at $50-$100 based on 6 hours of runtime and cluster configuration."
      },
      "Justification": [
        "The configuration balances performance and cost for processing large datasets.",
        "Shuffle-heavy operations and wide transformations require significant compute resources."
