    "1.1 Java Spark Runtime Cost": {
      "Cluster Configuration": {
        "Number of Executors": 4,
        "Executor Memory": "16 GB",
        "Driver Memory": "8 GB"
      },
      "Approximate Data Volume Processed": {
        "Input Data": "Approximately 10% of the total data volume (~7 TB), including tables like DimUser, FactClaimTransaction, DimCheck, DimClaim, DimExposure, and DimClaimant.",
        "Output Data": "Approximately 1 TB after processing and filtering."
      },
      "Time Taken for Each Phase": {
        "Shuffle-heavy JOINs": "Not applicable (no explicit joins in the script).",
        "Wide Transforms (e.g., ROLLUP, DENORMALIZE)": "Not applicable (no complex transforms in the script).",
        "Output Writes": "1 hour for writing processed data to storage."
      },
      "Cost Model": {
        "Pricing Model (e.g., DBU, vCPU Hour)": "Enterprise DBU Cost: $0.0146 - $0.1008 per hour (based on cluster size and cloud provider).",
        "Total Runtime Cost": "Estimated $150â€“$300 for processing the data volume over a 4-executor cluster for 10 hours."
      },
      "Justification": [
        "Minimal processing logic as the script primarily involves table creation.",
        "Direct mapping of table definitions to Spark schema objects.",
        "Resource allocation based on indicative data volume and processing requirements."
