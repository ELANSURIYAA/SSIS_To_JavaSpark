"Summary": "This SSIS package is designed to load and transform data for the DimUser table. It includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, along with error handling and logging mechanisms.",
"Functional Modules": [
"Data extraction using OLE DB Source.",
"Transformations including lookups, conditional splits, and derived columns.",
"Data loading into DimUser table using OLE DB Destination."
],
"Data Pipelines Overview": "The data flow begins with the extraction of staging data, followed by transformations to ensure data integrity and accuracy, and concludes with loading the transformed data into the DimUser table."

"Join Handling Strategy": "Rewrite JOINs using Spark DataFrame API with explicit join conditions.",
"Complex Ops Handling": "Use Spark operations like groupBy, agg, and distinct for NORMALIZE, ROLLUP, and DEDUP equivalents.",
"Output Refactoring": "Rewrite OUTPUTs to HDFS or Parquet using Spark's write API."
},
"5. Optimization Techniques in Spark": {
"Join Optimization": "Use broadcast joins for small lookup tables and shuffle joins for large datasets.",
"Partitioning Strategy": "Partition datasets based on PublicID and BeanVersion fields.",
"Caching Strategy": "Cache intermediate results to reduce recomputation.",
