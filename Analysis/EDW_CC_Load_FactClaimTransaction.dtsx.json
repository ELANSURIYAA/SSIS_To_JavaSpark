"1. Script Overview": {
"Summary": "The SSIS script 'EDW_CC_Load_FactClaimTransaction.dtsx' is designed to load and transform data related to claim transactions into the FactClaimTransaction table. It integrates data from multiple source systems, performs lookups, transformations, and conditional splits, and ensures data consistency and accuracy.",
"Functional Modules": [
"OLE_SRC - Guidewire Tables: Extracts data from Guidewire tables.",
"LKP - Producer: Performs lookup for producer-related data.",
"LKP - Location: Performs lookup for location-related data.",
"LKP - CreateUserID: Performs lookup for user creation data.",
"LKP - ClaimAdjuster: Performs lookup for claim adjuster data.",
"LKP - Agency: Performs lookup for agency-related data.",
"LKP - TransactionDate: Performs lookup for transaction date data.",
"LKP - LossDate: Performs lookup for loss date data.",
"LKP - Exposure: Performs lookup for exposure-related data.",
"LKP - Claimant: Performs lookup for claimant-related data.",
"LKP - Check Transaction: Performs lookup for check transaction data.",
"CSPL - Check BeanVersion: Splits data based on BeanVersion match.",
"Load FactClaimTransaction: Loads transformed data into FactClaimTransaction table."
],
"Data Pipelines Overview": "Data is extracted from Guidewire tables using an OLE DB Source component. Lookup transformations are performed to enrich the data with additional attributes from dimensional tables. Derived columns are generated to add calculated fields, and conditional splits are used to separate data based on BeanVersion comparison. Finally, the transformed data is loaded into the FactClaimTransaction table using an OLE DB Destination component."
