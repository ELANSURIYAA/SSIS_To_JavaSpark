"1. Script Overview": {
"Summary": "This SSIS script is designed to load and update the DimClaimant table in the EDW_CC database. It includes data flow tasks, SQL commands, and metadata for processing claimant data. The purpose of the script is to extract, transform, and load claimant data from multiple sources into the DimClaimant table while handling updates and inserts based on business logic.",
"Functional Modules": [
"DFT - DimClaimant: Data Flow Task for processing claimant data.",
"SQL - Conclude Process Completed: Finalizes the process if successful.",
"SQL - Conclude Process Failed: Finalizes the process if failed.",
"SQL- Initiate Process: Initiates the process.",
"OLE_SRC - Get Source Data: Extracts source data for processing.",
"LKP - DimClaimant: Performs lookup operations on the DimClaimant table.",
"OLE_DEST - Load DimClaimant: Loads processed data into the DimClaimant table.",
"CMD - Update Existing Claimant: Updates existing claimant records."
],
"Data Pipelines Overview": "The script orchestrates data flows by extracting source data, performing lookups, applying transformations, and loading data into the DimClaimant table."
