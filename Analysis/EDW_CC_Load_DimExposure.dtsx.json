"1. Script Overview": {
"Summary": "This SSIS script is designed to load and update the DimExposure dimension table in a data warehouse. It integrates data from multiple sources, performs transformations, and ensures data consistency for reporting and analytics.",
"Functional Modules": [
"Data flow tasks: Extract staging data, lookup transformations for validation, derived columns for calculated fields, conditional splits for data categorization.",
"SQL commands: Update DimExposure table with calculated fields and batch processing.",
"Event handlers: Log errors and ensure process continuity."
],
"Data Pipelines Overview": "The data flow begins with extracting staging data using an OLE DB source. Lookup transformations validate existing records in DimExposure. Derived columns calculate additional fields such as BatchID and LegacySourceSystem. Conditional splits segregate data into insert, update, and unchanged categories. Finally, the data is loaded into the DimExposure table using an OLE DB destination."
